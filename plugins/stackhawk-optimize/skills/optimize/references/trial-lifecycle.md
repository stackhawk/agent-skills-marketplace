# Trial Lifecycle

> Setup mode builds + references the policy (steps 1–4, no scan); Refine mode runs the trial
> scan and promotes/discards (steps 5–9). Setup is re-runnable and is what hawkscan onboarding invokes.

## How a named policy reaches a scan (why this is non-destructive)
When `app.scanPolicy.name` is set in `stackhawk.yml`, HawkScan bootstrap detects an
org-level policy and downloads it directly from S3 at scan start
(`AssetManagerClient.getDownloadedAsset(orgId, SCAN_POLICY, name)`), applying its tech flags
+ plugins and then layering the local `includePluginIds`/`excludePluginIds` toggles. The
application's own stored policy/flags are never read or mutated by this path.

## Naming
Trial policy name: `OPTIMIZE_TRIAL_<APP>_<ENV>`, transformed to match `^[A-Z0-9_]+$`
(uppercase; replace any non `[A-Z0-9]` run with `_`). Deterministic so re-runs are
idempotent.

## Create (trial)
1. Build the trial `ScanPolicy` JSON (base preset + edited tech flags + toggled plugins).
2. Clean up any stale orphan first: `hawk op policy delete --name OPTIMIZE_TRIAL_… --yes`
   (ignore "not found").
3. `hawk op policy create --file <tmp.json> --name OPTIMIZE_TRIAL_… --display-name "Optimize trial (<APP>/<ENV>)"`.
4. Back up `stackhawk.yml` — but guard against clobbering a good backup: if
   `stackhawk.yml.optimize-bak` ALREADY exists (a prior crashed run left it), do NOT
   overwrite it — it holds the true original. Warn the user, reuse the existing backup, and
   skip re-copying. Only when no backup exists, copy `stackhawk.yml` →
   `stackhawk.yml.optimize-bak`.
5. Set `app.scanPolicy.name` and the corrections; show the diff.

## Promote
1. Ask the user for a permanent policy name (default `OPTIMIZE_<APP>`), upper-snake.
2. Ensure the policy JSON is available, then create the permanent policy. The trial policy
   already lives on the platform, so do NOT assume the local `<tmp.json>` survived (a
   resumed/crashed session may have lost it). If `<tmp.json>` is missing, reconstruct it
   from the live trial policy: `hawk op policy get --name OPTIMIZE_TRIAL_… > <tmp.json>`.
   Then `hawk op policy create --file <tmp.json> --name <PERMANENT>`.
3. Update `stackhawk.yml app.scanPolicy.name` → `<PERMANENT>`; remove the backup file.
4. `hawk op policy delete --name OPTIMIZE_TRIAL_… --yes`.
5. (Optional) `hawk op policy assign --app <APP> --name <PERMANENT>` to set the platform default.
6. Leave the `stackhawk.yml` change staged for the user to review/commit (do not commit for them).

## Discard
1. `hawk op policy delete --name OPTIMIZE_TRIAL_… --yes`.
2. Restore `stackhawk.yml` from `stackhawk.yml.optimize-bak`; remove the backup file.

## Failure handling
Any error after step "Create 3" → run the full Discard sequence, then report the original
error.
